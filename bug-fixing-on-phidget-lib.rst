Platform:
=========
1. Raspbian on Raspberry Pi
#. Phidget Interface Kit 8/8/8 (I/O board)
#. Python (2.7 or 3.2) on Pi
#. PhidgetPython API installed


Context:
========
There is a bug with Phidget's Python library. If you want to work with Phidget I/O board using this library 
on Raspberry Pi then there might be a problem in running your script. It may throw an **AttributError** exception all time. 

I had tried to run TemperatureSensor-sample.py script provided by Phidget support and got the following errors:

	pi@raspberrypi ~/Python $ sudo python TemperatureSensor-simple.py
	
    Traceback (most recent call last):
	  File "TemperatureSensor-simple.py", line 71, in <module>
	    temperatureSensor.setOnAttachHandler(TemperatureSensorAttached)
	  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Phidgets/Phidget.py", line 655, in setOnAttachHandler
	    self.__onAttach = self.__ATTACHHANDLER(self.__nativeAttachEvent)
	**AttributeError: TemperatureSensor instance has no attribute '_Phidget__ATTACHHANDLER'**


Issue:
=====
1. The Phidget.py module in phidget's python library, located at **/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Phidgets/Phidget.py** , instantiates various event handlers. 

2. Those handlers are later used by your script, if you import Phidget.py module. The module generates those handlers based on your host platform, like, WIndows, Linux, Mac etc. 

3. Platform information is generated by a Python command **sys.platform** .

4. By default, the module has the option for 'win32' *(Windows)* , 'darwin' *(Mac)* and 'linux' *(Linux)*.  

5. So it seems pretty obvious that the Raspberry Pi should also be covered by these options, since it uses Linux kernel. 

6. But unfortunately, the platform name Python generates for Pi is **'linux2'** not 'linux'. 

7. Thats why the Phidget library can not recognize it and thus fails to instantiate the required event handlers.



Solution:
========
To overcome this problem, you just need to make a way to introduce Raspberry PI's platform name to the Phidget's python library.

To do this just replace the following line in Phidget.py 

	elif sys.platform == 'darwin' or sys.platform == 'linux':

by this one:

	elif sys.platform == 'darwin' or sys.platform == 'linux' **or sys.platform == 'linux2':**

So simple!! Right!!!
